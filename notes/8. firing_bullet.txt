FIRING BULLETS

In AlienInvasion, we need to modify _check_keydown_events() to fire a bullet
when a player presses the spacebar. We don't need to change 
_check_keyup_events() because nothing happens when the spacebar is released.

We also need to modify _update_screen() to make sure each bullet is drawn to
the screen before we call flip().

We know there will be a bit of work todo when we fire a bullet, so let's
write a  new method _fire_bullet(), to handle this work.

First we import Bullet, then we call _fire_bullet() when the spacebar is
pressed.

In _fire_bullet(), we make an instance of Bullet and call it new_bullet().
We then add it to the group of bullets using the add() method. This method is
similar to the append() method, but it's a method that's written specifically
for Pygame groups.

The bullets.sprites() method returns a list of all sprites in the group
bullets. To draw all fired bullets to the screen, we loop through the sprites
in bullets and call draw_bullets() on each one.

When we run alien_invasion.py now, you should be able to move the ship right
and left, and fire as many bullets as you want. The bullets travel up the
screen and disappear when they reach the top.
