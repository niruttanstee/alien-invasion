RUNNING THE GAME IN FULLSCREEN MODE

Pygame has a fullscreen mode that you might like better than running the
game in a regular window. Some games look better in fullscreen mode, and
macOS users might see better performance in fullscreen mode.

We can do this by modifying the __init__() method.

When creating the screen surfacem we pass a size of (0, 0) and the parameter
pygame.FULLSCREEN. This tells Pygame to figure out a window size that will
fill the screen.

Because we don't know the width and height of the screen ahead of time, we
update these settings after the screen is created.

We use the width and height attriutes of the screen's rect to update the
settings object.
