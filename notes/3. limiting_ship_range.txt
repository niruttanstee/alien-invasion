At this point, the ship will disappear off either edge of the screen if we
hold down an arrow key long enough. Let's correct this so the ship stops
moving when it reaches the screen's edge.

We can do this by modifying the update() method in the Ship class.

The code checks the position of the ship before changing the value of 
self.x. The code self.rect.right returns the x-coordinate of the right edge
of the ship's rect. If this is less than the value returned by the
self.screen_rect.right, the ship hasn't reached the right edge of the screen.


REFACTORING _check_events()

The _check_events() methid will increase in length as we continue to develop
the game, so let's break _check_events() into two more methods:
one that handles KEYDOWN events and another that handles KEYUP events.

We make two helper methods.
