DELETING OLD BULLETS

At the moment, the bullets disappear when they reach the top, but only
because Pygame can't draw them above the top of the screen. The bullets
actually continue to exist; their y-coordinate values just grow increasingly
negative.

This is a problem, because they continue to consume memory and processing
power.

Thus we will do something called garbage collection to get rid of the bullets.
Otherwise, the game will slow down from doing so much unecessary work.

To do this, we need to detect when the bottom value of the bullet's rect has
a value of 0, which indicates the bullet has passed off the top of the
screen.

As we can't remove items from a list or group within a for loop, we have to
loop over a copy of the group. We use the copy() method to set up the for
loop, which enables us to modify bullets inside the loop.

We then check to see if the bullet has disappeared off the top of the screen.
If it has, we then remove it from bullets.

We then insert a print() call to being deleted when they reach the top of the
screen.
