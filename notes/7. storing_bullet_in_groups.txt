STORING BULLETS IN GROUP

Now that we have a Bullet class and the necessary settings defined, we can
write code to fire a bullet each time the player presses the spacebar.

We'll create a group in AlienInvasion to store all the live bullets so we can
manage the bullets that have already been fired. 

This group will be an instance of the pygame.sprite.Group class, which 
behaves like a list with some extra fuctionality that's helpful when building
games.

We'll use this group to draw bullets to the screen on each pass through the
main loop and to update each bullet's position.

The group is created in __init__()

When we call update() on a group, the group automatically calls the update()
for each sprite in the group. The line self.bullets.update() calls
bullet.update() for each bullet we place in the group bullets.
