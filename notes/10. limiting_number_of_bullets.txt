LIMITNG THE NUMBER OF BULLETS

Many shooting games limit the number of bullets a player can have on the
screen at one time; doing so encourages players to shoot accurately.

We'll do the same in Alien Invasion.

First, store the number of bullets allowed in settings.py.

We'll use this setting in AlienInvasion to check how many bullets exist 
before creating a new bullet in _fire_bullet(). When the player presses the
spacebar, we check the length of bullets.

If len(self.bullets) is less than the number specified, then create a new
bullet. Otherwise do nothing.

We'll now refactor the AlienInvasion class to create a seperate method for
bullet management. We'll call this method _update_bullets().
